** You must have Python3 and PyQT5 installed to run this program **

To run:
1) Open ChatHost.py on first system
2) Enter IP Address and Port into their respective text fields and click "Host" (The program will appear to be unresponsive until a client connects)
3) Open ChatClient.py on second system
4) Enter the Host's IP and Port into their respective text fields and click "Connect" 
** The client connection must be done AFTER the host has begun hosting and is waiting for a connection **
5) The two chat programs should now be connected to each other: Type a message in the text box on the right and then click "Send Message" to send
6) To close the connection send the message 'q' (without quotes) from either client and then close both programs.
